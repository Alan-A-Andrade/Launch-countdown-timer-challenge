## My process

### Built with

- React.js
- Styled Components
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I pretty much bitted more than I could chow here, but im proud of the final product, I can see where the code need improvements, but is deployed and function under my time constriction.


### Continued development

I still need time to learn more about react and programming in general, I need to improve my logic.


### Useful resources

- [Change color of SVG](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This helped me a lot in controlling the SVG icon colors.
